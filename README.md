### Enable billing for project:
Go to [this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) to see your billing accounts.

If you have multiple, do the following:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Platform Console.
Open the console left side menu and select Billing.

2. If you have more than one billing account, you'll be prompted to select Go to linked billing account to manage the current project's billing.

3. Under Projects linked to this billing account, locate the name of the project that you want to change billing for, and then click the menu next to it (3 dots).


Our project is called demo.
